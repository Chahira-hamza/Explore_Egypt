We need to use 2 design patterns: (suggestion: Singleton for Admin, and ... ?)

1. User class (inherit from it for tourguide & for advertisers): log in/ log out/ forget password (sql queries + java class + drawing GUI )
Documents: SDS
	
2. Admins's functionality (sql queries + java Class + drawing of the GUI pages you want with the options and functions calls specified)
Make Admin singleton
Documents: STP (with number 4)


3. Tourist's functionality (sql queries + java Class + drawing of GUI pages)
Documents: test cases


4. GUI pages for Admin & Tourist
Documents: STP 

Each one adds the tasks he does in the Project Taskboard document and fill all the row's details as much as possible
Each one adds the functionality in the release document

We can ask about the difference between STP and test case documents, el 2 7asahom da5lin fe ba3d (testing) !
